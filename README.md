# Natural_Language_Processing_Specialization
This repository contains the materials for natural language processing courses from deep learning ai NLP series.

## Course 1: Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces 
Topics: Use logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies & translate words.

### Week1: Logistic Regression
In this class, I learnt to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifer for tweets using a logistic regression.  
Topics: Sentiment analysis, Logistic regression, Data pre-processing, Calculating word frequencies, Feature extraction, Vocabulary creation, Supervised learning

### Week2: Naive Bayes
Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier.  
Topics: Error analysis, Naive Bayes inference, Log likelihood, Laplacian smoothing, conditional probabilities, Bayes rule, Sentiment analysis

### Week3: Vector Space Models
Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. I learnt how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.  
Topics: Covariance matrices, Dimensionality reduction, Principal component analysis, Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Co-occurrence matrices, Vector representations, Vector space models

### Week4: Machine Translation
Learnt to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality sensitive hashing, in order to perform machine translation and document search.  
Topics: Gradient descent, Approximate nearest neighbors, Locality sensitive hashing, Hash functions, Hash tables, K nearest neighbors, Document search, Machine translation, Frobenius norm
